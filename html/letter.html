                        You reassure me all the time whenever I had doubts and when you gave me the love jar, I knew then that you truly understood
                        and knew me. You always know exactly how and what to say to make me feel better.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of our distance and the things we have going on in our lives individually, we don't have as much time together as
                        we did before. In spite of that, I hope to reassure you just as you have with me, not because I'm trying to pay you back
                        or anything but because I love you and I want you to know that:>
